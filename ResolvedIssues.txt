Issue: 
Fail to parse text from within the tag

Solution: 
Need to move the parser a little bit more,  if(parser.next()==XmlPullParse.TEXT)

Issue: 
Can only parse the first 3 entries from the xml

 
Solution:
Just realize that the limit of string in UTF-8 is about 65553 bytes. Converting my target xml to UTF-8 
  gives me 360kb. Then 65553b/360kb < 20% of the file. Explains why I could only parse 3 entries from the xml.
Instead of parsing it from a string, use  parser.setInput(inputstream, "UFT-8") instead
